# Data

The data used in these notebooks are publicly avialable and notebooks are provided documenting the entire data preparation proceedure in `prepare_data`.

For convenience, we provide already prepared matrix files in `.h5ad` format, which are used by the notebooks in this directory, generating the plots shown in the manuscript.
The files are available at `http://file.biolab.si/opentsne/h5ad/`.

# Python environment

The exact Python environment used to generate all the results in the manuscript is provided in `pip_env.txt`.
